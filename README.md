# pangu_chinese_2.0_ipa
just the original pangu 9.2-9.3.3 jailbreak .ipa for sideload via <a href="cydiaimpactor.com">cydia impactor>, perhaps. use it wisely.

this is really to use only if you hate the ignition.fun or tweakboxapp or the other pangu 9.2-9.3.3 jailbreak with the grey background and grey app icon, here ya go. sideload with cydia impactor or xcode if you have a mac.
