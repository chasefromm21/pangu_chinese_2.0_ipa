# pangu_chinese_2.0_ipa
just the original pangu 9.2-9.3.3 jailbreak .ipa for sideloading from the computer (mac, windows, linux even!), perhaps.

perhaps i should mention... this is really to use only if you cant stand the ignition.fun or tweakboxapp or the other pangu 9.2-9.3.3 jailbreak with the grey background and grey app icon to install via ota on the device itself, and if thats the case, then here ya go. sideload with <a href="http://cydiaimpactor.com">cydia impactor</a> (download impactor) (or you can use xcode if you have a mac, but thats a bit more difficult. so use impactor then...).

do use wisely, and respect the panguteam, long-live pangu and the taig team!
