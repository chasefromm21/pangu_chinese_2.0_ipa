# pangu_chinese_2.0_ipa
just the original pangu 9.2-9.3.3 jailbreak .ipa for sideloading from the computer (mac, windows) perhaps.

perhaps i should mention... this is really to use only if you cant stand the ignition.fun or tweakboxapp or the other pangu 9.2-9.3.3 jailbreak with the grey background and grey app icon to install via ota on the device itself, and if thats the case, then here ya go. sideload with <a href="https://github.com/pixelomer/AltDeploy/releases">altdeploy</a> (download altdeploy) (or you can use xcode if you have a mac, but thats a bit more difficult. so use altdeploy then...).

please use this jailbreak wisely, and respect the panguteam, long-live pangu and the taig team, and long-live ios 8, and ios 9. best firmwares from apple *ever* (released almost 10 years after my best la jolla trip ever in early 2006!)
